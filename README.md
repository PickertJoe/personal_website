# personal_website
This repo contains all of the files associated with my personal website, pickertjoe.com

This site was built through Python using the Django framework and is hosted on the Heroku platform. Static files are serviced via the S3 platform available through Amazon Web Services (AWS).

All HTML and CSS features were coded from scratch and leaned heavily on the Bootstrap framework to create a responsive site compatible with a wide range of screen resolutions.

June 5, 2021: This app was converted to a static website that now lives at [old.joepickert.dev](https://old.joepickert.dev)
