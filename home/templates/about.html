            <br/>From the peaks of Colorado, to the depths of backend software development, I've done a lot of
            exploring in my young life. I've also worn many different hats.<br/><br/>

            I am an Eagle Scout, a National Merit Scholar, an award winning researcher, a former mountain guide,
            and an unrepentant bookworm.<br/><br/>

            But the one constant throughout all my endeavours has been my consistent ability to exceed in novel
            and challenging circumstances.<br/><br/>

            I am a young professional seeking to build on my newfound passion for software engineering through
            meaningful employment. If you would like to learn more about how my diverse and unique skillset can help you
            or your business, please<a class='btn-link' href="{% url 'contact' %}">reach out!</a>
